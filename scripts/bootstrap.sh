# needs what. See REPO-STANDARDS.md STD-SCRIPT-5.
#
# This stays a per-repository file rather than shipping in @rcrsr/rill-dev,
# which carries the rest of the shared dev assets: it performs the install that
# would fetch that package, so it cannot live inside its own prerequisite.
#
# This deliberately does NOT install git hooks. `prepare` already does that on
# every install, so duplicating it here would give two places to keep in sync.
# What install cannot do is assert the preconditions, which is this script's
# job.
#
# Idempotent: safe to run on a clean tree, a stale tree, or twice in a row.
#
# Repository-agnostic. Everything it enforces is read from the root
# package.json, so the file is the same in every repository.
