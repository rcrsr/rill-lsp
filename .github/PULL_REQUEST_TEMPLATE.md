<!--
Keep the sections that carry weight for this change and delete the rest.
Summary and Verification are the two that always earn their place.

Prose beats bullet fragments here. Name files, symbols, and line numbers, and
show the command output you are claiming. A reviewer should be able to re-run
what you ran.
-->

## Summary

<!-- What the code does now, in a few sentences. Lead with the change, not the
file count. -->

## Why

<!-- The defect or gap this closes, and what a consumer gains. If an issue
already argues this, link it and keep this short. -->

## Approach

<!-- The judgement calls, not a file-by-file walkthrough. Cover anything a
reviewer would otherwise have to reconstruct: why this pipeline step, why this
data shape, what you rejected and what it cost.

If an issue settled a design, say where this follows it and where it departs.
An unflagged deviation costs a review cycle. -->

## Verification

<!-- Concrete commands and their real output. Numbers, not adjectives.

  pnpm check      exits 0
  pnpm test       <N> passed

State what you did NOT verify as plainly as what you did. If a change has no
runtime surface to exercise, say so and say why. -->

## Risk

<!-- Behaviour that changes for existing consumers, new failure modes, anything
loud that used to be quiet. Delete if genuinely none. -->

## Follow-up

<!-- Work this deliberately leaves out, and why it is out of scope here. Delete
if none. -->

Before requesting review:

- `pnpm check` passes locally. CI repeats it across the Node matrix.
- Tests execute and the count is what you expect. A suite that fails to import
  reports as a file-level failure, not as failing tests, so a broken import can
  read as "no failures" at a glance.
- New tests fail when the change is reverted. A test that passes without your
  implementation is measuring something else.
- Handlers are tested against broken documents and edge positions, not only
  valid scripts. See CONTRIBUTING.md.
- A new handler and its entry in `SERVER_CAPABILITIES` land together, and the
  README capability table lists it.
- Request handlers never throw. They return an empty result on bad input.
- Version bumps are not needed. Maintainers handle releases.
